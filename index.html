      <h2>Experience </h2>
      <p>During the Summer of 2025 I interned for Image Line, a PR and Exhibitions company in London. I was a UX Design Intern working on the Image Line Exhibitions website. I helped streamline their product offerings, redesigned a logo and landing page for one of their hero products, created new web graphics, and restructured several key webpages. I redesigned graphics while maintaining their brand colors and typefaces.
